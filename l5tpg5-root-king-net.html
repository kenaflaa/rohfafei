Happy MLK day! Anybody have any other teams they're rooting for this season? LeBron is my favorite player, so normally my secondary team would be whatever team he's on - but for some reason, it's really hard to root for the Lakers. I still want LeBron to succeed, but the Lakers are not fun or interesting to watch like the Cavs/Heat/Cavs were (ESPECIALLY without LeBron), so this season my second team are the Timberwolves. It basically just comes down to the fact that they are fun to watch У нас вы можете скачать книгу архитектурное конструирование.

Team to root for in bold+italics  EST. amp#x200B; Hornets vs Hawks 8:00pm : The Hornets are currently one seed below the Celtics, and if we are going to try and push for the top 3 seed, we must pull away from every neck on neck team. 76ers vs Knicks 8:00pm : I hate both of these teams, but we should hope the Knicks serve.

Been a fan for 28 years. In recent years, I’ve followed the Nuggets pretty hard (mostly because we have done many transactions with them). Just wondering if die hard fans have followed others, or if fans of other teams have the Blazers in mind too. Tell your stories.

Pistons - Get Blake Griffin for the entire offseason+full season, hopefully he is healthy in the playoffs for once. And get Reggie Jackson healthy for the full season too. Kings - Haven't been in the playoffs for 10+ years. Also like their commentators and Buddy Hield.

I am an 18 year old NBA fan from Orange, California. I have been a gigantic NBA fan for 10 years but have not had a team to root for. I have always wanted to be a fan of an NBA franchise but I just have not found one yet. After a while I finally decided that it is time to pick an NBA franchise to root for. None will be a greater choice then the Kings who have a great coach in George Carl. They also have NBA all stars in Demarcus Cousins and Rajon Rondo.

Greetings everyone, today i want to cover, well, the things i have stated in the title, the subplot of White fang and how racism has been portrayed in the show. In my honest opinion, it has not been done well. I will not claim as to why this is the case, maybe they did not have enough time to develop it, maybe they didnt have the experience, maybe a grimm appeared and ate all of the writting on it. I do not know. However, i will analyze it mainly by comparing it to 3 other portrayals of racism. Let me start with the fact that, I admit that I am not a big historian on the books and my theory below has holes in it, but am posting it anyway hoping that those smarter than me might be able to pick up the pieces of where my theory falls flats. A lot of “What If’s” detailed below, but those that are smarter than me might be able to connect the dots better. amp#x200B; In summary, the three-eyed Raven is the ultimate “bad guy” in this story. amp#x200B; April 30th, 2016 marks as the inauguration date of the Rocket League Championship Series  It's a day where in some people's cases - like myself - have discovered the esports side of Rocket League and I have been hooked on it ever since to the point I'm now one of the people involved in updating a wiki. It's hard to believe it's already been 3 years. I made a post last year (https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueEsports/comments/8fxadu/rlcs_2_year_anniversary_happy_birthday/?st=jv3xl1xoamps. Item #: SCP-001 Object Class: Keter Author: not\_a\_seagull “The sky above the port had the color of television, tuned to a dead channel” Hello SCPDeclassified, Brewsterion here. Today, I wanted to tackle the winner of the semi-recent 144-Hour Jam contest, not\_a\_seagull's proposal for SCP-001, The Sky Above The Port. If any of you are familiar with TSATPWTCOTTTADC, you'll recognize this as part of one of our favorite cyborg's name, but it's also a quote from the book Neuroman. 
Edit: after S8E3 this can all still be true, but Bran maybe more likely he just say peace out guys I've gotta jump back in time and make sure everything happens the way it did. Keeping all the causality consistent but letting the other character move on while he continues living his hell over and over. This is a theory for what's going on in the show, but I've seen lots of support from lines in the books. It's obviously an expansion on an old theory. I wanted to post it to this subreddit. # MAME 0.209 (https://www.mamedev.org/?p=468) With another month over, it’s time for another release, and MAME 0.209 is sure to have something to interest everyone.

Regular contributor shattered has added Кузьмич-Егорыч (Kuzmich-Egorych), a Russian Mario Brothers bootleg running on heavily modified Apple II hardware. In other Apple One of the most interesting mysteries in OPM is the identity of Blast. He's the highest ranked hero in the association, has been active for decades, and is universally respected even by the ornery members of the S Class. Despite that he's had only one proper appearance and is shrouded in mystery, even when every other member of the s class has been developed in one way or another. It's likely Blast won't take center stage until we reach the end of the story, or at least close to it, given It can be irrefutably shown that the Canaanites at Ugarit had these beliefs. But just because they did, does that mean the Israelites had the same beliefs? In fact, there is every evidence the religion of Ugarit, and the religion of ancient Israel were not the same and did not come from the same source. I wonder what evidence is there for the claim that the Israelites were indeed Canaanites, that their religion has evolved from Canaanite polytheism and that they worshiped Earlier today Meeple Like Us linked to a reddit post I did last year and I thought it would be good to update it. So here we are. I hope this helps people considering KS and makes it a more positive experience for them. It is a really fun platform if used right. ampnbsp; So what is the intent of this post? To offer some lessons learned and advice based on my 70+ kickstarter projects . Please understand everyone's mileage/experiences With 4.5 hours of GOT left, I think people are jumping the gun way too early on saying we’re only going to get some simple, bland, fairy tale ending (cough, /r/ASOIAF, cough). And even if we do, there is no point in not savoring our final weeks with this show. So, in the spirit of that, here is my tinfoil theory on the final twist GRRM gave DampD (We know the other two of the three were Shireen and Hordor): Credit where it is due, my original inspiration to write this came after googling. I started this list in 2016 but thought it was time to bring it back. I've tried to mark things that were specific to the 2016 election but let me know if anything else is dated but sounds current so I can fix it.
