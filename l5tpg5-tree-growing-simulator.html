I was thinking about what I could do to spice up their modded game, and I realized that adding Moonballs would be a fun idea for both fans and non-fans alike. So I sat down last night and made it. # Background For those of you that don't know me, I've been making mods since about 2014. I created the first version of the "Tree Twerking Mod" (https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1294678-tree-growing-simulator-2014-make-your-skyblock) I created a new modpack called MinecraftUpgrade on technic plataform in 1.7.10 version. Come play all together in my server and have fun! There is a video of me playing the first time and also how to install and explaining everything about it. His current language is in portuguese but check the mod list. First Looks: https://youtu.be/ESW\_e4wE0hg (https://youtu.be/ESW_e4wE0hg) Installation etc: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp6xkoVPaKc (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp6xkoVPaKc). There is a mod I have just discovered and learned to love, called Dynamic Trees (https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/dynamictrees?gameCategorySlug=mc-mods&projectID=252818). It manages the impressive feat of being a shockingly detailed tree growing simulator (just read through the feature list - you'll find it goes on way longer than you thought it would) while at the same time integrating itself seamlessly into Minecraft, to such a degree that after a few hours you forget Sometimes it's nice to revisit the old with some new twists included. You are welcome to join my premium hosted customized Agrarian Skies 2 server. Added mods include various Thaumcraft addons, OreExcavation, Ex Compressum, TreeGrowingSimulator, Magical Crops, and Mekanism. Plugins are supported as well. FTBU is used for claiming your base. You can find the modpack on my discord which is here: https://discord.gg/TPyMhqg (https://discord.gg/TPyMhqg). it crashed and i don't know whats causing it. here is the crash report. thank you if you can help me. i'm running skyfactory two with the ATlauncher btw. at com.google.gson.Gson.fromJson(Gson.java:803)  12 more A detailed walkthrough of the error, its code path and all known details is as follows: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- System Details -- Details: Minecraft Version: 1.7.10 Operating System: Windows 10 (amd64) version. So I added a bunch of mods to another pack, and it required me to add MineTweaker. So I have, and MineFactoryReloaded seems to be crashing. But when I remove it, it does not work regardless. Does anybody know the cause, or how I can fix it with preferable all the mods included still in tact? ------ ---- Minecraft Crash Report ---- // I let you down. Sorry :( Time: 12/16/17 3:46 PM Description: There was a severe problem during mod loading that has caused the game to fail cpw.mods.fml.common. I've had a look around this subreddit to see if I was able to find a fix for my current problem, but I have not been able to. I followed this video, same as another guy did, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gwf6F6EpaGQ But when I run the Forge.jar not all of the files are generated, not even the EULA (Tried making my own but this did not fix it). I get the following crash-report; ---- Minecraft Crash Report ---- // On the bright side, I bought you a teddy bear! Time: 24-02-17 18:15 Description. Im playing a custom 1.10 pack but some mod is causing nether quartz to explode when mined. not all the time just a chance of it. it wasnt an issue to begin with but im now setting up an auto fortune machine and it just exploded it. does anybody know which mods cause this My mod list Mantle (by mDiyo) Tinkers Construct (by mDiyo) Inventory Tweaks (by Kobata) JourneyMap (by techbrew) Chameleon (by jaquadro) Storage Drawers (by jaquadro) Iron Chests (by progwml6) Pam's HarvestCraft (by MatrexsV. 
I recently created a wireless crafting bench from applied energistics and now whenever I launch the game it crashes. Difficulty:Hard Mode:normal (cause screw titan/kappa) World type: Garden of glass Visited:Nether, darkness, and have portal to aether(never gone through) Immediately prior to the first crash I broke the ME Interface. I accidentally had put the wireless bench in there, got it back from my system. However the inerface flashed with items from my system with out stopping. Tried. so I made my own little mod pack, with some mods that I want to play with, and a weird thing I notice, is my character in the inventory freaks out, arms legs just spasm around, and sometimes when I place stuff, I just get insane speed and the controls go weird, sometimes they are just inverted other times D goes forward and A backwards. I really hope someone can help, because I love these mods, but it's annoying to play with. I dont get any crashes Im playing 1.10.2 Mods: Agricraft, B.A.S.E. Good evening, everyone. I am mostly a console gamer, only recently coming back to modded Minecraft and thus PC. Not being a PC gamer means I didn't care much about upgrading my computer past browsing-capable so it has only 4GB RAM. I can run 1.10.2 just fine, but not with the 180+ mods SF3 has. I tried loading it and it froze, I could only run it and actually start playing after removing some 20 non-essential large mods (non-essential to me, it was just a test). It took like 20 minutes to start. 
My world worked fine one day, but the next day it just will not open and crash even ever I try. Here's the crash report: ---- Minecraft Crash Report ---- // Who set us up the TNT?

Hey guys, Previously, the PO2 server I run used YAMS to run the server. It ran well for quite some time, however it recently starting having database issues upon restarting the server. At this point, it doesn't feel worth it to continue trying to figure that problem out without reinstalling it from scratch. I've since moved on to Multicraft to give it a fair shot. Got it installed and copied everything into the proper server folder. I pointed Multicraft to the forge.jar file, bumped I'm trying to load Project Ozone and when I get to the 'finishing up' stage I crash. Can anyone help?
